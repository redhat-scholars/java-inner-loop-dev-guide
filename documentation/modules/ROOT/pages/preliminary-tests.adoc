Before you proceed with the actual lab let's introduce some basic tools and test them, namely:

* _OpenShift Web Console_
* _OpenShift Command Line Interface `oc`_

[#the_web_console]
=== The Web Console

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to perform various tasks via a browser.

To get a feel for how the web console works, click on this link:https://console-openshift-console.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%[Web Console,role='params-link',window='_blank'] link.

On the login screen, enter the following credentials:

*Username*:
[source,role="copypaste"]
%USERNAME%

*Password*:
[source,role="copypaste"]
%PASSWORD%

The first time you access the web console you would probably see the following. You can run or skip the `Developer Perspective` tour, your choice.

If you happen to be also the Cluster Administrator, you will be presented with an overview of the whole Cluster status:

[#command_line_interface]
=== Command Line Interface

OpenShift ships with a feature rich web console as well as command line tools to provide users with a nice interface to work with applications deployed to the platform.  The OpenShift tools are a single executable written in the Go programming language and is available for the following operating systems:

- Microsoft Windows
- Mac OS X
- Linux

You might already have the OpenShift CLI available on your environment. You can verify it by running an `oc` command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc version
----

You should see the following (or something similar):

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Client Version: 4.6.9
Server Version: 4.6.4
Kubernetes Version: v1.19.0+9f84db3
----

You can login using user and password and also very easily using a token. To do the latter, open the link:https://console-openshift-console.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%[Web Console,role='params-link',window='_blank'].

Then go to the upper right corner, click on your user name and select `Copy login command` and follow instructions.

NOTE: If the `oc` doesn't exist or you have an older version of the OpenShift CLI, follow the next sections to install or update the OpenShift CLI. Otherwise, skip to the next lab.
